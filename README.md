# SolarSystemSimulation

This is an interactive, scaled simulation of the Solar System using Godot. You can change the distance of planets from the sun, change their masses, and change the universal gravitational constant. Things break if u make the mass/distance/G too high + collisions may break it as well.

Things to make it better:
  - Make planets draggable
  - Limit values of mass, distance and G to not break stuff
  - Better collisions
  - Add visual orbits and make them interactive ie, change how elliptical they are
  - Add ability to create bodies (planets, satellites, asteroids, comets)
    
Code is shit ngl
